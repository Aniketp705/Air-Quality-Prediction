# AQI Bucket Prediction App

## Overview

This project is a web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) bucket based on various pollutant concentrations and the date of measurement. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions and features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, including a custom dark theme.

The accompanying Jupyter Notebook (`AQI.ipynb`) details the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training process (demonstrated with a Logistic Regression model). The Streamlit application (`main.py`) utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model for predictions.

*   **AQI Bucket Prediction:** Predicts one of the following AQI buckets:
    *   Good ‚ú®
    *   Satisfactory üëç
    *   Moderate ‚ö†Ô∏è
    *   Poor üò∑
    *   Very Poor üö®
    *   Severe üõë
*   **Color-Coded Results:** Displays the prediction with a color corresponding to the AQI bucket's severity.
*   **Custom Styling:** Features a custom dark theme for improved aesthetics.

## Model Details

### Model Used in the App

The Streamlit application (`main.py`) uses a pre-trained **Random Forest classifier** (`aqi_random_forest_best_model.pkl`) for predicting the AQI bucket. The input features are scaled using a pre-trained **StandardScaler** (`aqi_scaler.pkl`).

### Data Preprocessing (as shown in `AQI.ipynb`)

*   **Missing Value Imputation:**
    *   Numerical features: Imputed with the mean.
    *   Categorical features (AQI_Bucket): Imputed with the mode.
*   **Duplicate Removal:** Duplicate rows were dropped.
*   **Feature Scaling:** Numerical pollutant features were standardized using `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn.

### Feature Engineering

The following features are used for prediction by the model in `main.py`:

*   **Pollutant Concentrations (12 features):** PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene.
*   **Date Features (4 features):**
    *   Year
    *   Month
    *   Day
    *   Day of the week

## Dataset

The model development process (shown in `AQI.ipynb`) used the `city_day.csv` dataset, which typically contains daily air quality data for various cities, including pollutant concentrations and AQI values.

## Model Training and Results (from `AQI.ipynb` - Random Forest Classifier)

The `AQI.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the model training process using a Random Forest Classifier model for multiclass classification.

*   **Model:** `RandomForestClassifier` with hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
    *   Best Hyperparameters:
        *   `n_estimators`: (Value from notebook, e.g., 170)
        *   `max_depth`: (Value from notebook, e.g., 27)
        *   `min_samples_split`: (Value from notebook, e.g., 4)
        *   `min_samples_leaf`: (Value from notebook, e.g., 1)
        *   `class_weight`: 'balanced'
*   **Best Cross-Validation Accuracy (during tuning):** (Value from `random_search.best_score_`, e.g., 0.9678)
*   **Test Set Accuracy:** (Value from `test_acc`, e.g., 0.9751)

*   **Note:** The `AQI.ipynb` notebook details the hyperparameter tuning process using `RandomizedSearchCV` and evaluates the best `RandomForestClassifier` found. The classification report above is based on the test set evaluation of this tuned model.

**Note:** The Streamlit application (`main.py`) uses this pre-trained Random Forest model (`aqi_random_forest_best_model.pkl`).
